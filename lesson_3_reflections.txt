When contributing to a large project or when feedback is needed on a large project.

So if there are any merge issues they can be fix without there being new files created. 

Forks are for cloning repositories on git hub and linking back to the creator. Clone are copies either created locally or from git-hub. Branches are different versions of said repository. Forks are good for making your own version of a repository while the original files and owner can keep theirs intact. Clones are good for making an extra copy and branches are for trying new directions with said project.

So you have an understanding of where the project is most up to date and where merge conflicts could happen and how to avoid them.
